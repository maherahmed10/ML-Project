# Examining Bias With Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project involved the development of a custom sentiment analysis algorithm tailored for opinion-based writing, using Python and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. The primary objective was to create a highly accurate model capable of discerning nuanced sentiments within diverse written opinions.

Key Achievements:
Data Collection and Pre-processing:

Acquired a comprehensive dataset comprising over 10,000 meticulously labeled examples. The thoughtful selection and preparation of this dataset formed the cornerstone for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.

Employed advanced techniques to engineer text features that effectively captured the intricacies of opinion-based writing. These enhancements significantly improved the model's ability to discern nuanced sentiments, leading to an impressive 94% accuracy on a comprehensive test dataset.
Conference Presentation:

Presented the project's findings and methodology to conferences within Waterloo, receiving positive feedback from peers and industry professionals. This experience not only showcased the project's success but also facilitated valuable connections within the machine learning community.

Future Developments:
The achievements of this sentiment analysis project provide a solid foundation for ongoing advancements and applications. Future efforts will focus on continuous model refinement, exploration of additional feature engineering possibilities, and the integration of cutting-edge techniques to further enhance accuracy and applicability.
